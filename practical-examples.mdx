## 1. Broad wiki for the whole project

If you initialized Davia with your coding agent (for example `davia init --agent=cursor`), the agent already knows it should use Davia to generate the wiki.  
In that case, even a very broad prompt like this will work:

```text
Document this project.
```

Your agent will use its tooling to scan the project, generate an initial wiki, and create interactive docs and whiteboards.

<Note>
  If you did not run <code>davia init --agent=&lt;your-agent&gt;</code>, make
  sure your prompt explicitly mentions Davia and that you want a local wiki. For
  example: `Use Davia to generate a local wiki that documents this project.`

## 2. Focused wiki for a specific part (e.g. schemas)

You can also guide your agent to document only a specific area of the codebase and structure the output in a particular way.  
For example, to document only your schemas/classes and organize them in a table:

```text
Using Davia, generate a wiki page that documents only the schemas/classes
in this project. For each schema, include a row in a table with:
- the schema name
- a short description
- its main fields and relationships.
```

This kind of prompt narrows the scope and gives your agent a clear output structure, resulting in a more targeted, immediately useful wiki page.
