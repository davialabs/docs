## Davia pages are “living documents”

They follow a unique architecture combining editable content with interactive components.
Each page is self-contained: it holds your content, your interactive components, and your data. Think of it as **a document you can read, edit, and interact with**.

This is a new authoring paradigm: code is generated and compiled on the fly as you work. Describe what you need and the page can become anything—custom UI,
logic, and data flows—without fixed blocks or rigid templates.

## A single hub for creating, using, and sharing interactive docs

    <br />
    Whether you have a page with multiple components or just notes, each one of them
    is accessible in the tree on the left side of your screen. <br />
    <br /> Your can create new pages, insert subpages in a current one or rename
    it. All in all, your **workspace behaves like a filesystem**.
  </Card>
</Columns>

All your pages are aggregated in your **workspace** which serves as your **personal document hub**.
Bear in mind that once you import an interactive document to your workspace, it becomes your personal copy. Any data stored is specific to your usage and **remains private to you**.
