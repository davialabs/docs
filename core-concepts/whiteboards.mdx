Each page in Davia can embed whiteboards. Whiteboards are interactive canvases where you can create visual diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrations.

## Everything is editable

In Davia, all content is editable:

- **Text in the editor** - Click and edit any text content directly in the page editor
- **Charts in whiteboards** - Click on any element in whiteboards to edit, move, or modify it

This means you can refine your documentation and diagrams as you work, without switching between different tools or modes.

## Mermaid diagrams become whiteboards

<Info>
  Your coding agent generates Mermaid diagrams when creating documentation.
  These are automatically transformed into interactive whiteboards, giving you
  visual flowcharts and diagrams that you can edit directly without leaving your
  page.
