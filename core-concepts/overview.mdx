## Davia pages are "living documents"

They follow a unique architecture combining editable content with interactive components.
Each page is self-contained: it holds your content, your interactive components, whiteboards, and your data. Think of it as **a document you can read, edit, and interact with**.

This is a new authoring paradigm: code is generated and compiled on the fly as you work. Describe what you need and the page can become anything, from custom UI to logic and data flows, without fixed blocks or rigid templates.

## A single hub for creating, using, and sharing interactive docs

      Whether you have a page with multiple components or just notes, each one of
      them is accessible in the tree on the left side of your screen. <br />
      <br /> Your can create new pages, insert subpages in a current one or
      rename it. All in all, your **workspace behaves like a filesystem**.
