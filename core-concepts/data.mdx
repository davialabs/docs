## Your workspace has a global data layer

In Davia, each piece of data lives **globally in your workspace**. Any interactive component (and by extension, any page) can read and update that data.
Your workspace has a set of shared, named **databases** you can plug components into.

<Info>
  This paradigm makes your documents **connected by design**. Build something in
  one place, and use the same data in another — with no manual syncing.
</Info>

When you ask Davia to generate a new component, it often also scaffolds the data it needs and automatically connects the component to that database. This means your component is usable right away — no manual setup or wiring required.
