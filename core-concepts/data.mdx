## Your workspace has a global data layer

In Davia, each piece of data lives **globally in your workspace**. Any interactive component (and by extension, any page) can read and update that data.
Your workspace has a set of shared, named **databases** you can plug components into.

<Info>
  This paradigm makes your documents **connected by design**. Build something in
  one place, and use the same data in another — with no manual syncing.
</Info>

When you ask Davia to generate a new component, it often also scaffolds the data it needs and automatically connects the component to that database. This means your component is usable right away — no manual setup or wiring required.

## Where data lives

All data files are stored in `.davia/assets/data/` as JSON files. They can be organized in nested folders.

```
.davia/assets/
├── data/
│   ├── users.json
│   ├── config.json
│   └── analytics/
│       └── sales.json
```

## JSON structure

Data files must be **valid JSON**. For most use cases, **top-level arrays** are preferred — similar to database tables.

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "role": "Admin" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "role": "User" }
]
```

<Warning>
  Avoid deeply nested structures. Keep properties flat and primitive whenever
  possible — this makes data easier to display and edit.
</Warning>

## Two ways to display data

### 1. Database Views (for tabular data)

Embed JSON directly in an HTML page as an interactive table:

```html
<database-view data-path="data/users.json"></database-view>
```

<Info>
  Database views only work when the JSON root is a **top-level array**. Each
  array item becomes a row in the table.
</Info>

### 2. MDX Components (for custom UIs)

For charts, forms, or custom layouts, use an MDX component that imports and binds to the data:

```mdx
import users from "~/data/users.json";

export function UserList() {
  const { data, updateData } = useData(users);
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );


}
```

## Data is shared, not scoped

The same JSON file can be imported by **multiple components across different pages**. When one component updates the data, all components using that file see the change.

<Tip>
  To share data between pages, simply import the same JSON file path in each
  component. No extra wiring required.
</Tip>
