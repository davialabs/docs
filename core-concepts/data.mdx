## Your workspace has a global data layer

In Davia, each piece of data lives **globally in your workspace**. Any interactive component (and by extension, any page) can read and update that data.
Your workspace has a set of shared, named **databases** you can plug components into.

<Info>
  This paradigm makes your documents **connected by design**. Build something in
  one place, and use the same data in another — with no manual syncing.
</Info>

When you ask Davia to generate a new component, it often also scaffolds the data it needs and automatically connects the component to that database. This means your component is usable right away — no manual setup or wiring required.

## Data on an interactive document is persistent

When a component on a document stores or updates data, that information is **persistent** — it stays saved in your workspace until you change it.

- **Persistent = saved**: If you click a button that increases a counter from 2 to 3, close the page, and come back later, it will still show **3**.
- **Shared across the document**: All components on that document that point to the same database see the same up‑to‑date values.

<Tip>
  A simple way to think about it: your pages don’t just display content — they
  also remember things.
</Tip>

## Connected pages inside your workspace

Because data is global, interactive pages can share it seamlessly. You can build different experiences on separate pages that all point to the same database:

<Accordion title="Here's an example of a single database for multipe pages:">
Create a **Task Manager** on one page to add and update tasks <br />
Show **Analytics** on another page that reads those same tasks and displays
charts <br />
Add an **Admin Panel** elsewhere to moderate or reset the same data
</Accordion>

</Card>

All of these pages stay in sync because they are connected to the **same persistent data** in your workspace.

## Good to know

- **Privacy in your workspace**: Data in your workspace is your personal copy and stays private to you.
