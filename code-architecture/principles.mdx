title: "Core Principles"
description: "Davia apps are **single-page applications** that follow a unique architecture combining static HTML content with interactive MDX components. Each app is designed as a self-contained unit where all functionality is aggregated into a single, cohesive experience."

### 1. **One Component Per Page Rule** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**This is the most important rule in Davia apps:**

- **Each HTML page can have exactly ONE MDX component file**
- **Component paths MUST always start with `components/...`**
- **All requested functionalities MUST be aggregated into this single component file**
- **Components MUST be created BEFORE the HTML page that references them**

**Why This Matters:**

- Prevents system errors and broken functionality
- Ensures clean separation of concerns
- Maintains consistent data flow and state management
- Simplifies debugging and maintenance

### 2. **Dual Content Architecture**

Davia apps use a hybrid approach combining two content types:

#### **HTML Pages** - Static Content Foundation

- **Purpose**: User-facing content structure and basic formatting
- **Content**: Text, headings, lists, blockquotes, basic formatting
- **Schema**: Strict Tiptap ProseMirror schema compliance
- **Editing**: Users can directly edit these pages in the interface
- **No State**: Pure content only - no data handling or state management

#### **MDX Components** - Interactive Functionality

- **Purpose**: Interactive widgets, forms, charts, dynamic functionality
- **Content**: React components, JSX expressions, shadcn/ui components
- **State**: Component-scoped data persistence using `useData()` hook
- **Scope**: Isolated to individual components (no cross-component data sharing)
