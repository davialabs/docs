# The Quiet Revolution

Davia introduces a new paradigm: **your team’s knowledge updates itself in the background**.  
Instead of relying on people to manually document every change or decision, Davia connects to your everyday tools — Slack, GitHub, and more — and automatically captures updates as they happen.

<Tip>
  This means your internal documentation evolves continuously, keeping your
  workspace in sync with how your team actually works.
</Tip>

## Background agents for living documentation

Davia introduces AI agents quietly working behind the scenes — reading your PRs, Slack discussions, and technical notes — and updating your workspace’s documentation in real time.

> When a pull request is merged, a specification is updated, or a discussion resolves an open question, Davia automatically reflects those changes in your internal docs.

## A workspace of interactive documents

Unlike traditional documentation platforms built on static pages or rigid templates, Davia operates inside a **workspace of interactive documents**.

  This is a new authoring paradigm: code and content are generated and compiled
  on the fly as you work. This implies that your range of creation is infinite
  from a simple note to a fully custom interface, complete with logic, data
  flows, and interactive components.
</Card>

Because Davia’s AI has full creative freedom inside this workspace, it can **design the best form for your documentation** — whether that means a diagram, a table of dependencies, or a workflow summary — without being confined to static blocks.

## Full control stays with you

While Davia’s agents can write and update in the background, **you remain the author**.

- You can **edit directly inline**: every page is live and editable like a document.
- When the AI proposes an update, you can **accept or reject** it with a single click.

This keeps the workflow fluid: the AI does the heavy lifting of maintaining documentation, while you decide what stays.

## In summary

Davia is where your team’s knowledge system becomes self-maintaining: an AI workspace that listens, writes, and keeps your documentation up-to-date in the background, while still giving you full creative and editorial control.
