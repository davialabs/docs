description: "Davia is an open-source tool for AI coding agents to generate interactive documentation."
---

Davia is an **open-source** package you install in your project. When you run `davia init`, it creates a `.davia` folder in your project root and installs instructions for your coding agent.

Your AI coding agent writes documentation files locally with interactive visualizations and editable whiteboards that you can edit in a Notion-like platform or directly in your IDE.
