## What is Davia?

**Davia is an open-source tool your AI coding agent can use to generate interactive wiki** with visualizations and editable whiteboards that help you understand large codebases.

Install it as an **npm package** in your repo. Your coding agent will automatically know how to write and document your codebase. **You can edit everything locally**.

Here's how it looks:

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Davia CLI, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can install them from the official [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Davia CLI">
    Install the Davia CLI globally so you can run Davia commands from any project:

    ```bash
    npm i -g davia
    ```

    You can run this command from anywhere on your machine.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Davia with your coding agent">
    Inside your project, initialize Davia and tell it which AI coding agent you’re using:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Cursor
    davia init --agent=cursor
    ```

    ```bash Github Copilot
    davia init --agent=github-copilot
    ```

    ```bash Windsurf
    davia init --agent=windsurf
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    If you don't want to link your IDE's agent, simply run <code>davia init</code>.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate documentation with your AI agent">
    Open your AI coding agent in this repository and ask it to document your codebase using Davia.

    For example, you might say:

    ```
    Generate an interactive documentation for this project,
    include visualizations and editable whiteboards.
    ```

    Your agent will use Davia’s paradigm to create interactive documents (diagrams, flows, and editable spaces) directly from your code and project structure.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View your documentation locally">
    Once your agent has generated the documentation, open the Davia workspace to visualize the generated wiki:

    ```bash
    davia open
    ```

    This will open the workspace in your browser.
    If the page doesn’t load immediately, simply refresh your browser tab and the doc should appear.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync your workspace to the cloud">
    When you’re happy with the local wiki, push it to the cloud so you can collaborate with your team in real time:

    ```bash
    davia push
    ```

    This command will:

    - Ask you to log in if you haven’t already (via a browser window)
    - Create a new workspace for your project
    - Upload your generated documentation
    - Open the cloud workspace in your browser

  </Step>

<Note>
  <strong>Not yet supported:</strong> updating an existing cloud workspace
  you’ve already pushed. <br />
  For now, each <code>davia push</code> creates a new workspace. Support for updating
  an existing workspace is coming soon.
