## Your workspace has a global data layer

In Davia, each piece of data lives **globally in your workspace**. Any interactive component (and by extension, any page) can read and update that data.
Your workspace has a set of shared, named **databases** you can plug components into.

<Info>
  This paradigm makes your documents **connected by design**. Build something in
  one place, and use the same data in another — with no manual syncing.
</Info>

## Data on an interactive document is persistent

When a component on a document stores or updates data, that information is **persistent** — it stays saved in your workspace until you change it.

- **Persistent = saved**: If you click a button that increases a counter from 2 to 3, close the page, and come back later, it will still show **3**.
- **Shared across the document**: All components on that document that point to the same database see the same up‑to‑date values.

<Tip>
  A simple way to think about it: your pages don’t just display content — they
  also remember things.
</Tip>

## Connected pages inside your workspace

Because data is global, interactive pages can share it seamlessly. You can build different experiences on separate pages that all point to the same database:

<Accordion title="Here's an example of a single database for multipe pages:">
Create a **Task Manager** on one page to add and update tasks <br />
Show **Analytics** on another page that reads those same tasks and displays
charts <br />
Add an **Admin Panel** elsewhere to moderate or reset the same data
</Accordion>

All of these pages stay in sync because they are connected to the **same persistent data** in your workspace.

## Publishing a live site: how data behaves

When you publish a page as a **live Davia site** (not as a template), the data that page uses is published with it.

What that means:

1. **Visitors write to live data**: Any interaction on your live site — submitting a form, clicking Like, adding a vote — updates the published database.
2. **Everything connected stays connected**: Other components or pages **in your workspace** that point to that same database will reflect those changes.
3. **You can monitor from your workspace**: Build a dashboard in your workspace that tracks your live site in real time. For example, publish an **interactive survey** and keep a **live results dashboard** in your workspace showing responses as they come in.

<Warning>
  Be careful when changing data fields after publishing. Altering or removing
  fields can break connected components or make older data incompatible. If you
  need to evolve your schema, consider versioning your database or adding new
  fields instead of replacing existing ones.
</Warning>

## Good to know

- **Privacy in your workspace**: Data in your workspace is your personal copy and stays private to you.
- **Templates are different**: When you publish a **template**, others import a personal copy of your interactice document along with its example data into their workspaces.
