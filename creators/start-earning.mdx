## How It Works

**You can earn money on Davia by creating and sharing your interactive docs.**

First, [publish your doc as a template](/creators/publishing-as-template) so others can use it. Once your template starts getting usage (imports by other users), you can get verified to start earning money. We reward you based on how many times your doc is reused by other users - how many times your interactive page was imported by someone else.

## Earning Structure

**Our pricing is simple :**

- **First 10 reuses**: $5 per reuse
- **Reuses 11-200**: $1 per reuse
- **200+ reuses**: Custom partnership plans
