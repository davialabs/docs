## Share, reuse, and build together

The Davia community is built on open, reusable interactive documents. When you publish a doc to the public hub, anyone can import it into their own workspace — including the content, components, and example data you include — just like cloning a repository on GitHub.

<Info>
  Importing creates a **personal copy** in the user's workspace. Their edits and
  data are private to them and do not affect your original doc.
</Info>

## How importing works

- **One‑click import**: Users browse the hub and import your doc. Davia copies the page, components, and any bundled example data into their workspace.
- **Independent evolution**: Imported docs can be edited, extended, or combined with other components without affecting your original.
- **Attribution**: We surface the original creator and doc link on the imported page to credit your work.
- **Updates**: If you publish improvements later, users can re‑import the latest version as a new copy, or you can optionally publish variant pages.

## Copyright and community use policy

### Your rights as a creator

- You retain **full copyright** over your original content and code.
- Publishing to the hub grants Davia and hub users a **non‑exclusive license** to view, import (clone), and use your doc within Davia workspaces, including making private modifications.
- Public re‑publishing of materially derivative works must include **attribution** to the original page and creator.

### What others can do with your published doc

- **Allowed**: Import to their workspace, modify privately, remix with other components, and use commercially within Davia (e.g., internal or client work).
- **Allowed with attribution**: Re‑publish a derivative doc to the hub; they must credit you and link to the original.
- **Not allowed**: Removing attribution, misrepresenting authorship, or redistributing your content/code outside Davia without your permission.

### Takedowns and disputes

- If your copyrighted work appears on Davia without authorization, you can request removal. Email: contact@davia.ai with links, proof of ownership, and the allegedly infringing page.
- We may remove content that infringes, violates law, or breaches this policy, and may suspend repeat offenders.
