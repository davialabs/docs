By default, each app you create is **private** and resides in your personal workspace. When you want to share an app, you can publish it on the hub. It'll then be available for anyone to import **for free** in their own workspace.

## Add mock data and showcase your app's functionalities

It's good practice to add some mock data when publishing your app. **This data will be reset** whenever a user imports your app, so they can start fresh with their own content.

<Tip>
  Keep your mock data minimal - just a few examples are usually enough to
  showcase your app's functionality
</Tip>

On your app's page, you can also write and edit a description that provides context for future users. Think of it as a **user guide that explains how to use your app effectively**.

## Keep track of your published app's performance

Once your app is published, you can monitor its performance through various metrics:

- **Import count** - Track how many times your app has been imported by users
- **Likes received** - See how many users have liked your app
- **View count** - Monitor how many times your app page has been viewed

These insights help you understand your app's popularity and user engagement, allowing you to make improvements and better understand your audience.
