By default, each document you create is **private** and resides in your personal workspace. When you want to share an doc, you can publish it on the hub. It'll then be available for anyone to import **for free** in their own workspace.

## Add mock data and showcase your interactive doc's functionalities

It's good practice to add some mock data when publishing your doc. **This data will also be imported** to the user's workspace when they'll use it.

<Tip>
  Keep your mock data minimal - just a few examples are usually enough to
  showcase your doc's functionality
</Tip>

On your page, you can also write and edit a description that provides context for future users. Think of it as a **user guide that explains how to use your interactive doc effectively**.

## Keep track of your published doc's performance

Once your doc is published, you can monitor its performance through various metrics:

- **Import count** - Track how many times your doc has been imported by users
- **Likes received** - See how many users have liked your doc
- **View count** - Monitor how many times your doc page has been viewed

These insights help you understand your doc's popularity and user engagement, allowing you to make improvements and better understand your audience.
